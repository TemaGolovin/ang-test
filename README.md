# AngTest

## Description

Test front-end application written using Angular with the possibility of fake authorization. An authorized user can access posts received from the 'JSON placeholder' service that are on a separate route from the login, and each post can be opened on a separate page.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running end-to-end tests
